This is my first attempt to use the *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md) theme. 

This is in the context of a Hackathon in the company I work[^1]. 

# tasks

- [ ] Figure out how to show/hide some sections

# section 1 - show/hide feature

How can a section be shown/hide? We don't know yet. Just try.

## section 1a - what we know

First we need to see if the sections are inside a `<div>`. 

If not it will be difficult to join all of its paragraphs. 

## section 1b - what we can try

<input type=checkbox className="show-hide-next"/>
<div>
Another posibility is to add manuall a <div> tag enclosing the paragraphs.

In that way we have it them all together.
</div>
